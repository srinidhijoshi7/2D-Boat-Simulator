Boat Simulator
The boat simulation project aims to create a visually immersive experience of a boat sailing
in a dynamic environment using the OpenGL graphics library. The simulation incorporates
various features such as day and night modes, realistic sun and moon movements, and usercontrolled boat navigation.
The simulation environment consists of meticulously designed components, including a
dynamically rendered sky, sun, moon, clouds, Windmill and an animated sea. The boat
itself is represented by a series of interconnected polygons, providing a visually appealing
and realistic representation of a sailing vessel.
The project begins with a display function that presents project details, including the project
title, author names, and the guidance of a professor. After receiving user input to proceed,
a menu system is implemented, allowing the user to choose between different simulation
modes and control the boat's speed.
To ensure smooth interaction, the program incorporates various keyboard input functions,
enabling the user to adjust the boat's speed and direction. The boat's position is updated
accordingly, providing a seamless and responsive simulation experience.
